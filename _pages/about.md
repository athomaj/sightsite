  Who We Are
</h2> Each day, thousands of homeless animals are being put to death in animal shelters across the country. No animal should die just because he or she is homeless. The mission of Stayin’ Alive Long Beach is to be a voice for animals and promote an end to the unnecessary killing of healthy and treatable animals in the Long Beach Animal Care Services shelter. We will accomplish this by advocating for responsible, cost-effective policies and programs that will reduce population growth and increase adoption rates. It is our goal to see Long Beach Animal Care Services comprehensively implement these policies of responsible municipal sheltering to make Long Beach a safer place for animals and humans. New models of sheltering, based on innovative, non-lethal programs and services, have proven effective in progressive cities across the nation. We will work to create a similar benefit to the people and the animals of Long Beach, CA. Ultimately, our mission is to create a ‘No Kill’ city.

  The Jane Mattson Memorial Fund
</h2> A cherished friend and colleague, Jane Mattson founded Stayin' Alive Long Beach in 2012 to help save the lives of the animals at the Long Beach animal shelter. She was a true friend to  animals and was absolutely committed to their care and welfare. With courage and determination, she launched Stayin' Alive, and with it, she began a movement in support of shelter animals in Long Beach. Now, she has thousands of followers and has helped to save hundreds of shelter animals' lives. Because Jane felt so deeply about the path that shelter animals must walk, she requested donations be made to Stayin' Alive Long Beach to support and continue her efforts in changing shelter policies to save healthy animals from unnecessary strife and death.  All donations to this fund will be used to advocate for shelter animals and continue the important work Jane herself started. Jane was a beloved wife, daughter, friend and colleague. She was an animal advocate in every sense of the word, and words cannot adequately express how much we miss her.

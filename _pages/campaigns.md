## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out to Long Beach city council</span>

**Election 2018<img class="alignright wp-image-551 size-medium" src="http://dannymejiaindev.com/sightsite/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dog_speakerphone-e1492198266238-300x243.png" alt="" width="300" height="243" />** <span style="font-weight: 400;">The City of Long Beach municipal elections will take place on April 10, 2018.</span> Let your city council member know that you want change at the Long Beach Animal Care Services (ACS). ACS has euthanized more than 5,000 animals since Mayor Robert Garcia was elected in 2014.  If we don't take positive, proactive steps to change, more animals will die at the Long Beach shelter. To keep up with the 2018 municipal elections, see the [Election homepage][1]. **Current Legislative Branch**

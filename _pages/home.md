  The Jane Mattson Memorial Fund
</h2> Each day, thousands of homeless animals are being put to death in animal shelters across the country.   No animal should die just because he or she is homeless. The mission of Stayin' Alive Long Beach is to be a voice for animals and promote an end to the unnecessary killing of healthy and treatable animals in the Long Beach Animal Care Services shelter. We will accomplish this by advocating for the implementation of responsible, cost-effective policies and programs that will reduce population growth and increase adoption rates.  It is our goal to see Long Beach Animal Care Services comprehensively implement these policies of responsible municipal sheltering to make Long Beach a safer place for animals and for humans. New models of sheltering, based on innovative, non-lethal programs and services, have proven effective in progressive cities across the nation, and we will work to create a similar benefit to the people and the animals of Long Beach, CA. Ultimately, our mission is to create a No Kill city. [ezcol_end_both]   [ezcol_1half]

  Working to Make Long Beach A No Kill City
</h2> In 2016, Long Beach Animal Care Services killed over 1,660 companion animals in our city's animal shelter. That is 26% of the animals that entered the shelter's doors and includes a 40% kill rate for kittens, a 32% kill rate for cats, a 15% kill rate for dogs and a 10% kill rate for puppies. Recent improvements in animal sheltering, known as 

[the No Kill Equation][1], have reversed the killing trend in cities across the US. It can happen in Long Beach as well. Stayin' Alive Long Beach is a political advocacy group composed of concerned residents who want to see the progressive, fiscally-responsible programs of the No Kill Equation put in place at the Long Beach Animal Shelter. We invite you to join us as we work politically to increase the save rate of animals at the Long Beach Animal Shelter. [/ezcol_1half_end]

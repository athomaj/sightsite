## Working to Make Long Beach A No Kill City In 2016, Long Beach Animal Care Services killed over 1,660 companion animals in our city’s animal shelter. That is 26 percent of the animals that entered the shelter’s doors and includes a 40 percent kill rate for kittens, a 32 percent kill rate for cats, a 15 percent kill rate for dogs and a 10 percent kill rate for puppies. Recent improvements in animal sheltering, known as the No Kill Equation, have reversed the killing trend in cities across the United States. This can happen in Long Beach as well. Stayin’ Alive Long Beach is a political advocacy group composed of concerned residents who want to see the progressive, fiscally-responsible programs of the No Kill Equation put in place at the Long Beach Animal Shelter. We invite you to join us as we work politically to increase the save rate of animals at the Long Beach Animal Shelter.

### **The Jane Mattson Memorial Fund** A cherished friend and colleague, Jane Mattson founded Stayin' Alive Long Beach in 2012 to help save the lives of the animals at the Long Beach animal shelter. She was a true friend to  animals, absolutely committed to their care and welfare.  With courage and determination, she launched Stayin' Alive, and with it, she began a movement in support of shelter animals in Long Beach that now has thousands of followers and has helped to save hundreds of shelter animals' lives. We will miss Jane for her quick wit, her warmth and friendship, her endless caring for the animals, her courageous heart and her ability to grasp the truth and fight to bring it to light. Because Jane felt so deeply about the path that shelter animals must walk, she requested donations be made to Stayin' Alive Long Beach to support and continue her efforts in changing shelter policies to save healthy animals from unnecessary strife, and death.  All donations to this fund will be used to advocate for shelter animals and continue the important work Jane herself started. Jane was a beloved wife, daughter, friend and colleague.  She was an animal advocate in every sense of the word, and words cannot adequately express how much we miss her. If you wish to help us continue Jane's work of advocating for Long Beach's shelter animals, you can donate at

  The Jane Mattson Memorial Fund
</h2> Each day, thousands of homeless animals are being put to death in animal shelters across the country.   No animal should die just because he or she is homeless. The mission of Stayin' Alive Long Beach is to be a voice for animals and promote an end to the unnecessary killing of healthy and treatable animals in the Long Beach Animal Care Services shelter. We will accomplish this by advocating for the implementation of responsible, cost-effective policies and programs that will reduce population growth and increase adoption rates.  It is our goal to see Long Beach Animal Care Services comprehensively implement these policies of responsible municipal sheltering to make Long Beach a safer place for animals and for humans. New models of sheltering, based on innovative, non-lethal programs and services, have proven effective in progressive cities across the nation, and we will work to create a similar benefit to the people and the animals of Long Beach, CA. Ultimately, our mission is to create a No Kill city. [ezcol_end_both]   [ezcol_1half]

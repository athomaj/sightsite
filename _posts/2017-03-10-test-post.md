Stayin' Alive Long Beach is very happy to report that Long Beach Animal Care Services' (LBACS) Acting Director Ted Stevens has made an operational decision to not euthanize any adoptable cats and dogs on Monday, June 11th.  The decision was announced in the April 27th issue of the Signal Tribune.  Although the animal shelter is closed that day, we are encouraged to see that Director Stevens appears to be open to the idea that No Kill could be achieved in Long Beach.  This is excellent news for the shelter animals of Long Beach.  Although Stevens has agreed not to kill any adoptable dogs and cats on June 11th, he declined to sign the national pledge (www.justoneday.ws), citing a lack of authority to do so. SALB would like to see LBACS sign the pledge in 2013, and further, to make extra efforts on that day to place those healthy and adoptable animals in homes.

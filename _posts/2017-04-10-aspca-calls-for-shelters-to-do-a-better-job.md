<span style="font-size: medium;">The ASPCA has released a "<a href="https://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/position-statement-responsibilities-animal-shelters">Position Statement on the Responsibilities of Animal Shelters.</a>" It is a call to "elevate the expectations we have of shelters." Many of the things the ASPCA now advocates for are the things Stayin' Alive advocates for at the Long Beach animal shelter. </span> <span style="font-size: medium;">Here's a short statement from the ASPCA President: "This call to elevate the expectations we have of shelters—and of one another—means setting baseline standards on housing, sanitation, medical treatment, disease control, socialization protocols, and other behavior interventions.</span> It means removing delays to making surrendered animals immediately eligible for adoption. It means acting without prejudice against people—based on economic, social, racial or cultural reasons. Likewise it means not acting against animals based solely on breed. It means ensuring shelters have the flexibility to reduce or waive adoption fees. We simply can’t afford to put barriers between suffering animals and safe homes. It means continuing our efforts—with the highest standards—to transfer shelter pets to rescue groups or to areas where they stand a better chance of adoption, and doubling down on efforts to reconnect owners with their lost pets. It means legally requiring ID tags for all owned dogs and cats living or venturing outdoors, and ending any use of hold times as a reason for euthanasia. Finally, it means shelters committing to transparency—releasing data on intake and outcomes, including euthanasia. Transparency is one of the most effective ways to build community trust and support; secrecy is one of the fastest ways to lose it." ong Beach Animal Care Services fails to maximize the opportunities it has to save lives by not following many of the recommendations here, particularly this one, which is contained in the statement itself: "[A]nother critical responsibility of all shelters is finding homes or placement options for the animals in their care. Shelters should be required to take all steps necessary to ensure the placement of as many animals entering their facilities as possible, whether they arrive as owner surrenders, strays or through other means." No Kill is quickly becoming the mainstream view -- only out of touch shelters will continue to follow the traditional control-oriented model of sheltering. Out of touch is what we are in Long Beach. More than 3,000 animals have been killed since Mayor Garcia took office. How many more animals need to die before our City acts?

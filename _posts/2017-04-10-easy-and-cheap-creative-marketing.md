We love what Reno has done to be creative about saving animals at their shelter.  Entertainment + animals = a winning combination.  How about it Long Beach?  Summer's a great time for an adoption promotion -- how about: Beach Blanket Baby-lon - Adopt a kitten event for a reduced fee event The Good Old Dog Days of Summer - A senior dog adoption promotion "PAWSitive" Energy Adoption Event - Adoption event for energetic dogs The Purrfect Summer is here - Adopt an adult cat promotion Go Hawaiian adoption event - wear a Hawaiian shirt and get a reduced adoption fee Cost? Minimal to nothing. Increasing the number of saved lives?  Priceless. [maxbutton id="2" ]

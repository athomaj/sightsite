Who would have thought there were so many silly election cat photos were out there on the Internet? Well, here's a serious cat from one of them to remind us that on April 8th next year we're having an election in Long Beach, and that means it's time for Long Beach residents to *take action*. Shelter animals in Long Beach need you to speak up for them and let City Council know that you support the No Kill Equation at the Long Beach animal shelter. **Unless we speak up and let our voices be heard, 5,000 MORE dogs and cats will be killed at the Long Beach shelter next year. ** Number one on the agenda is a Comprehensive Adoption Program.Â  The shelter in Long Beach does NOT currently have an adoption program. Incredible, you say? Yes, we think so, too. Long Beach is full of animal lovers - the animal shelter, run by Long Beach Animal Care Services, needs to get in line with the values of the people of Long Beach by doing off-site adoptions, holding evening adoption hours for the working public, doing energetic marketing of animals and starting to work toward mobile adoptions. These are all part of a comprehensive adoption program. Write to your City Council member today - [here is a sample letter you can print out, sign and send][1]. The person who can make this happen is *you*. The animals are counting on us! [maxbutton id="2" ]

Stayin' Alive Long Beach has made specific recommendations to Long Beach Animal Care Services about how to make their website more public friendly and thereby increase  adoptions. Among SALB's recommendations are: 1. Provide clear information about ADOPTING -rotating pictures** that link directly to the pet's adoption information** -information about fees and how to choose a compatible pet - information about mobile pet adoptions 2.  Highlight PROGRAMS the shelter offers -**spay/neuter programs** -information that will help people keep their animals (e.g., house-training, dealing with barking, etc.) -microchip information -various events the shelter holds or sponsors (e.g., Trick or treating for homeless pets, pet care fairs, reduced fee days) 3.  Encourage PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, including: -Ways to foster (with a link to a foster application on the fostering page) -Ways to volunteer (they need a volunteer application and currently don't have one on this page) -Ways to donate 4.  Feature **positive, upbeat language and colors** that makes adopting a shelter pet sound attractive. The [LA Animal Care Services][1] website uses expressions like: - "love" and "hope" - "companion" - "save a life" - "how can we help you" - "you can make a difference" - the **colors **are light and bright.  Notice the white background. It's much more upbeat. - It also **clearly posts the shelter hours ** Ted Stevens, Acting Manager of LBACS, responded by saying that LBACS is "looking forward to making these changes" and that LBACS is "not happy with [the] current site at all."  We at Stayin' Alive Long Beach are hopeful that LBACS will be proactive and follow through on their intention to improve the LBACS website so that we can get started on the road to making Long Beach a progressive, No-KILL community.
